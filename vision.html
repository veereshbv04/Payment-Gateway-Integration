                <ul>
                    <li>To strengthen women’s resistance to violence both within the home and within communities, cultures and politics</li>
                    <li>To make families, communities and the state responsible for and responsive to the growing violence against women</li>
                    <li>To create alternative spaces and for a public debate and dialogue to bring about attitudinal and institutional changes in our society vis-à-vis discriminatory attitudes towards women</li>
                    <li>To infuse into public and political life the feminine ethic of care and compassion and draw in all sections of society to strive towards a world free from all forms of war, violence, intolerance and conflicts</li>
                    <li>To affirm women’s knowledges and wisdoms as also that of all vulnerable communities, marginalised and silenced by the dominant politics of progress and development</li>
                </ul>
